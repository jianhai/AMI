Summary     : A version of the VIM editor which includes recent enhancements
Description :
VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the
vi editor.  Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is
still very popular.  VIM improves on vi by adding new features:
multiple windows, multi-level undo, block highlighting and more.  The
vim-enhanced package contains a version of VIM with extra, recently
introduced features like Python and Perl interpreters.

Install the vim-enhanced package if you'd like to use a version of the
VIM editor which includes recently added enhancements like
interpreters for the Python and Perl scripting languages.  You'll also
need to install the vim-common package.
