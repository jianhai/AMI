Summary     : Parser and analyzer for backtraces produced by GDB
Description :
Btparser is a backtrace parser and analyzer, which works with
backtraces produced by the GNU Project Debugger. It can parse a text
file with a backtrace to a tree of C structures, allowing to analyze
the threads and frames of the backtrace and work with them.

Btparser also contains some backtrace manipulation and extraction
routines:
- it can find a frame in the crash-time backtrace where the program
  most likely crashed (a chance is that the function described in that
  frame is buggy)
- it can produce a duplication hash of the backtrace, which helps to
  discover that two crash-time backtraces are duplicates, triggered by
  the same flaw of the code
- it can "rate" the backtrace quality, which depends on the number of
  frames with and without the function name known (missing function
  name is caused by missing debugging symbols)
